# Amazon Gift List App

Create a `.env` file containing `BASE_URL`. If you are using ngrok, it might look like this:

```shell
BASE_URL=https://8a635fd5.ngrok.io
```

Ensure you have a local instance of Mongodb running and spin up the app by running `rack`.

**NOTICE**: This app is ridiculously insecure. Don't use it for real.
